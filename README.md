# Game : MathXercise
This is my first project using Flowgorithm.
Here I try to make a game called MathXercise.

MathXercise is a math game specially designed for kids to learn math in a fun and interactive way. This game offers an engaging learning experience while developing basic math skills.

MathXercise is not just a game, but also an effective learning tool to help children develop their love for math early on. With its fun and interactive approach, MathXercise makes an ideal learning companion for young children.

You can try playing the game by opening it using Flowgorithm :)
